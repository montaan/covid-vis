# Countries

This directory has country-level data, based on the Wikipedia list of countries and regions. The [Countries.ts](Countries.ts) file has population figures, and [CountryCases.ts](CountryCases.ts) has COVID-19 epidemic data. The [WorldTree.tsx](WorldTree.tsx) puts the two together for an individual-level visualization of the population of the Earth.
